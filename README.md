# JavaScript-Reps - alert('WIP');

This lil repo was created in mind to really get down to basics and get your basic JavaScript foundation down stat. This will feel like mental cardio if you do it right.

No NPM packages, Just an html file with .js scripts attatched.

Have fun to whomever is reading this! Ask yourself a lot of questions and keep grinding!

Have fun with this repo and play with the code as much as you can!
Traversy Media is the source for audio explanation. I have personally changed up a lot of the problems just to get the reps in. Also commented code is mine for notes.

Traversy Link url(https://youtu.be/hdI2bqOjy3c) The video is one hour and fourty some minutes. But if you do this right you should be at the computer for around five hours just breaking the crap out of it.

Other source links I recommend throwin your peepers on.
